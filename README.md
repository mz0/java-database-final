# Retail Management Backend System

DONE
1. Configure the project to work with databases. Backend should use
   * MySQL for structured data (e.g., store and product details)
   * MongoDB for unstructured or flexible data (e.g., order logs, tracking metadata).
2. Models: Store, Product, Customer, Inventory, Review, and other Order related models.
   Use JPA annotations, field constraints and relationships.
3. Repositories and Services to handle the business logic / CRUD operations and backend processing.
4. REST Controllers for the endpoints: creating store, list products, update inventory, and retrieve order details.

TODO

5. Load sample data: write SQL and MongoDB scripts to populate the database with initial sample data.
6. Stored procedures for common queries (e.g., checking stock availability across stores).
7. Integrate with the pre-built frontend and run the project, verify functionality.
